Waggle is an open platform for intelligent environmental sensors under development at [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.anl.gov/) (ANL). I worked under Rajesh Sankaran at ANL to implement the Waggle binary protocol for communication between sensor nodes and to develop a web application for monitoring incoming data from nodes.
