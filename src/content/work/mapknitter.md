MapKnitter is an online tool for making maps from aerial photos. I worked on MapKnitter as part of [Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/about_page), improving map annotation functionality and modernizing the codebase to make the site more maintainable.

MapKnitter 2.0, based on the work of Public Lab's 2014 GSOC students, was [released in February 2015](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-13-2015/announcing-mapknitter-2-0) and was the first radical overhaul of the site since its creation in 2009. 

[Leaflet.Illustrate](https://github.com/justinmanley/Leaflet.Illustrate) and [Leaflet.toolbar](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.toolbar) came out of my work on MapKnitter in the summer of 2014. I also contributed extensively to [Leaflet.DistortableImage](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage).
