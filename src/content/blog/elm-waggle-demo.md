### Elm Thoughts: Building An App With Elm

I was supposed to write a demo. A bunch of my friends had been talking up Elm, Ravi Chugh was teaching a class using Elm, and Evan Czaplicki, the creater of Elm, was coming to spend a week at the University of Chicago later in the quarter, so I figured I would give it a try.

### Successes 

* Supportive community

How does it compare to writing programs in JavaScript?

What were the challenges?
* Firing multiple HTTP requests - it's not intuitive - it requires understanding how Signals get wired together.
* Definitely layout challenges - Catch 22 w/

Thoughts about the community
* The language is definitely a work-in-progress.
* BDFL model - Evan makes decisions impacting the community and all existing codebases which seem arbitrary from the outside.
