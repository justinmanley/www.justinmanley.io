The Washington Park Arts incubator opened a year and a half ago on a bombed-out corner of Garfield Boulevard a block away from Washington Park.

This part of the city is full of history.  Washington Park was designed in the late 19th century by Frederick Law Olmsted, most famous for designing New York's Central Park.  Not far from the Arts Incubator, in the middle of the park, stands the Washington Park Swimming Pavilion, a pavilion from a time when even swimming pools were made to look vaguely Grecian and public works were meant to inspire above all.

[When was the swimming pavilion built?]

Despite this, the blocks around the arts incubator are filled with vacant lots.

What is the real endgame for the University?  What do they see in it?
