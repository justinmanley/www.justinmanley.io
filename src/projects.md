## WhereWeWalk
![WhereWeWalk]({{assets}}/images/wherewewalk.png)
Most surveys are verbal.  WhereWeWalk is a web survey tool designed for *spatial* questions.

This application was designed for the University of Chicago in 2013 / 2014.  The project was initiated by University of Chicago administrators who were curious about student traffic patterns on campus.  These administrators, responsible for planning campus improvements, wanted to understand the impact of recent capital improvement projects and to target future improvements to take advantage of existing usage patterns.

The survey presented students with an satellite map of campus (I used the Google Maps API) and asked them to draw on the map their path around campus on the previous day.  Using the responses we collected from undergraduates, I was able to map student traffic patterns and make recommendations to the University planning department.

This was an exciting tool to develop because urban planners, architects, logistics analysts, etc. can gain important insights by asking relatively few spatial questions.  Recent improvements in web map display technologies make it easier than every to ask spatial questions.  When combined with demographic and population statistics, these surveys can yield rich and interesting data sets.

All of the code for this project is open source.
