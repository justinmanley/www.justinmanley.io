We want to avoid sheetrock and use <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/05/architechture-of-american-folk-art-museum.html">materials with resonance and character.</a>”  <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/05/architechture-of-american-folk-art-museum.html">The building is created using poured-in-place concrete</a>, which means that the walls, the floor, the ceilings are all essentially part of the same continuous structure.  This type of construction has the feel of permanence as well as its actuality – concrete is one of the most difficult building materials to destroy.  In addition, because every part of the building is structural, it is much harder to modify.</p> <p>When the MoMA announced its intention to demolish the building, it cited the distinctive (i.e. non-glass) façade and the disconnect between the floor plates at the folk art museum and the MoMA next door.  If it was the idiosyncrasies of the folk art museum that created the conflict, it was the deliberate permanence of the building that made the problem intractable, even after six months deliberation.  The New York Times reported that, “Because the floor plates support the façade, a reconfiguration would require much of the building to be dismantled and reconstructed.”  Elizabeth Diller of Diller Scofidio + Renfro <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/arts/design/a-grand-redesign-of-moma-does-not-spare-a-notable-neighbor.html">admitted</a>, “We can’t find a way to save the building.  You pass a tipping point where there’s not enough of the original structure to actually maintain its identity.”<a title="" href="file:///C:/Users/Justin/Dropbox/Out%20of%20the%20Yards/Memory%20and%20Tragedy/American%20Folk%20Art%20Museum%201.docx#_ftn4"><br /> </a></p> <p>There is a sense, then, in which the building contained the seeds of its own destruction. The folk art museum building was designed to fit its original inhabitants forever, not to adapt – but change is inevitable.  True; with a different purchaser, the building might have been repurposed despite its resistance to change.  Even a building as idiosyncratic as the folk art museum might have been converted to offices, residences, or performance spaces.  But the architects’ design philosophy gambled the flexibility and future of the building against the ideal of creating a perfect space for the folk art collection.  The dreadful paradox is that what made the building great – the sense of permanence it evoked, the rich materiality of concrete and bronze, the unique interior spaces it created – also led to its destruction.</p> <p>Those who have <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrysaltz/statuses/422020014141497344">vilified the MoMA</a> argue that, as a museum, the MoMA holds a public trust to safeguard the folk art museum building as a work of great architectural value.  Some critics have even <a href="https://twitter.com/kimmelman/statuses/421074462361264128">imagined the building as an item in the MoMA’s collection</a>.  This conception of the building is a mistake.  Reducing the museum to an object, a piece of art, is to consider only its aesthetic and formal qualities, and to do so is to ignore those qualities which make it a building.  A building is such because it is designed to be used: Vitruvius’ utilitas.</p> <p>The MoMA is demonized because its decision is judged by a standard which disregards the present context of the folk art museum in favor of the architects’ good intentions and the fit for the original occupant of the structure.  The pens of the critics suspend the life of the building in the instant that it left the drawing board.  But try as critics might to hold back the press of time, the fecund city pushes on relentlessly.  The building must be judged in its current context, and part of that context is its usefulness as a space to be inhabited.</p> <p>Ah, the protesters say – but the building would be perfectly useful if not for the damned expansion of the MoMA.  Expansion is made a dirty word.  Yet – if anything, expansion should be good.  Paul Goldberger <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/01/american-folk-art-museum-demolition">admits</a>, “MoMA is as compromised by overcrowding as any museum I know…Lowry [the director] envisions the expansion as a way of creating much needed breathing space.”  So while the expansion of the MoMA is regrettable in its consequences, it is not the sign of moral corruption that critics would have us believe.</p> <p>The MoMA must bear responsibility for the tragedy of the demolition of the folk art museum – and it is a tragedy, if only because the building was loved dearly by many museumgoers.  But it should bear that responsibility as the sad result of a Hobson’s choice forced by the nature of the folk art museum and not as a badge of ‘<a href=" http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/12/momas-act-vandalism/">cultural vandalism</a>.’<a title="" href="file:///C:/Users/Justin/Dropbox/Out%20of%20the%20Yards/Memory%20and%20Tragedy/American%20Folk%20Art%20Museum%201.docx#_ftn6"><br /> </a></p> <p>The folk art museum was an eccentric, friendly building that enlivened and enriched the urban life around it – Herbert Muschamp once called it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/14/arts/architecture-review-fireside-intimacy-for-folk-art-museum.html">“companionable.</a>”  We cannot do without such structures, buildings that are dynamic, brave, and richly memorable.  It is true that the construction of such precious buildings is a gamble, that it comes at a price – but the worst that could come out of this demolition would be a swing to the other extreme: in place of the folk art museum, a building that is generic and utterly all-purpose.  We hope that, as it moves forward with plans for a new building, the MoMA will bear the responsibility of the demolition thoughtfully and look for meaning in its loss, mindful of the architectural promises and perils it embodied.</p> <p><span style="color: #999999;">This article was

The ticketing room is darkened, so that the ceiling feels much lower than it is.  Colored light behind the double doors at the far end of the space beckons you towards the rotunda and Turrell’s installation.  Entering the rotunda, you first notice the people &#8211; people standing, reclining on benches, lying on cushions on the floor &#8211; all staring up.  Then your gaze too is drawn upwards, into the vast shifting colors of <em>Aten Reign</em>.</p> <p dir="ltr">It is here on the floor of the rotunda that you first feel the effects of the installation on the architectural experience of the museum.  The Guggenheim is a social space.  This was radical in 1959 when the museum opened; in traditional museums, the focus is on the art &#8211; if for no other reason, because boxy galleries leave nowhere else to look.  At the Guggenheim, a visitor descending the spiral is normally presented with two views: to the left, the artwork, placed on the outer wall of the spiral ramp; to the right, over the balcony, the entire interior life of the museum.  The skylight above, the rotunda floor beneath, and the coils of the other side of the spiral seen from across the void are architectural drama at its finest.  The sheer spectacle of this view, and the recognition that the building is meant to be appreciated as a work of art in its own right, make it acceptable for visitors to turn away from the artwork, lean on the balustrade, and watch the human life of the museum, their fellow museum-goers across the spiral.</p> <p dir="ltr"><em>Aten Reign</em> returns the museum to a more solitary, introverted ideal.  The piece occupies the entire six-story rotunda and is created  by a six-tiered cone of white fabric suspended from the top of the rotunda lit from behind by countless LED lights.  The scrim used to create to the installation hides covers the museum’s spiral ramp.  As your head turns back and your eyes upwards, the crowds on the floor of the rotunda vanish, and you become aware of the purity and simplicity of<em> Aten Reign</em>.  The luminous ovals are uncluttered &#8211; no crowds up here!  The diagonal lines of the spiral ramp are restless and dynamic.  The horizontal structure of the installation communicates stability, an architectural reassurance that this is a safe place for repose and meditation.  <em>Aten Reign</em> embraces the teeming crowds below calmly, quietly, without brimming over.  Gone &#8211; until September 25th &#8211; are the days when one looked up and saw spectators looking down or across from every level of the spiral ramp.  No matter how full the rotunda, each visitor experiences <em>Aten Reign</em> alone.</p> <p dir="ltr">The continuity of Frank Lloyd Wright’s exhibition spaces here was just as revolutionary and just as shocking as their sociability.  Previous museums had conformed to traditional notions of architecture in which the interior is divided up into a series of self-contained exhibition spaces.  At the Guggenheim, Wright erased internal barriers by casting the primary exhibition space as a continuous spiral ramp.  The ramp, open to the central rotunda along its entire length, allowed space to flow freely and united the entire museum within a single enormous room.</p> <p dir="ltr"><em>Aten Reign</em> divides this space in two, defining a clear interior and exterior.   As you leave the rotunda and begin your sloping ascent through the museum, you move to the exterior of the installation.  Like the back of a big-box retail store, the exterior of the installation is all business: a plain fabric scrim &#8211; undecorated by LED lights &#8211; sealing off the gap between the balustrade and the ceiling. Visitors are expected to ignore this part of the installation.  It’s meant to be unobtrusive, not to encourage meditation or provoke insights &#8211; yet its effects on the architectural experience of the museum are significant.</p> <p dir="ltr">The fabric scrim hides the rotunda and blocks those cross-atrium views that animate the museum.  The openness of Wright’s design ensures that visitors are always aware of their position within the structure.  Turrell’s installation replaces Wright’s open space with a whitewashed tunnel.  Wright’s radical experiment with the infinite linear extension of space produced the Guggenheim; the backside of<em> Aten Reign</em> exposes this flirtation with infinity in a new way. The curve of the spiral limits the pedestrian’s scope of vision to thirty feet in front.and behind. There is no beginning or end, just the promise of the unknown beyond the curve of the walls.  This is a different kind of isolation than the solitude of <em>Aten Reign</em> proper: harsher, more uncomfortable.</p> <p dir="ltr"><em>Aten Reign</em> and the other installations present at the Guggenheim for this exhibition &#8211; <em>Afrum</em>, <em>Ronin</em>, <em>Iltar</em> &#8211; are typical of Turrell’s work in that the apparatus used are always carefully concealed.  The white scrim sealing off the gap between the ramp and the rotunda bears evidence to this; its purpose is to hide the metal scaffolding and LED lights used to create <em>Aten Reign</em>.</p> <p dir="ltr">When I saw <em>Afrum</em> at the Guggenheim, I walked into the room and stood at a distance from the cube.  I was self-conscious: I was noticing myself noticing the light.  Meanwhile, behind me, several children &#8211; surely not more than five years old &#8211; entered the room.  Followed by several mothers, they ran up to the cube of light at the corner of room, putting their hands in it and laughing at the shadows it made.  The bright light of the projector mounted high in the opposite wall caught the eye of one of these toddlers, and he turned: “Look!,” he pointed, and the other toddlers turned too, gazing up at the source of the light.  That gave their mothers enough time to catch them and tow them out of the room &#8211; but they left a lasting impression on me.</p> <p dir="ltr">Turrell is a master of illusion &#8211; and, as with all illusions, we &#8211; the viewers &#8211; are complicit in the deception.  We agree to look only at the light, forgetting its origin.  The <em>Afrum</em> toddlers reminded me that all of Turrell’s works have a source.  The light and the apparatus used to produce the light together produce an effect that is far more powerful than either alone.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Kunsthaus installation is simpler because its apparatus was more easily concealed and so intruded less into the life of the museum.  <em>Aten Reign</em>, by contrast, pushes into every part of the space. Sometimes, as on the ramp, its intrusions are uncomfortable and uncomplimentary.  Its secret is that the architectural extremes that Frank Lloyd Wright sought to capture are exposed most clearly in these moments.</p> <p dir="ltr">It is rare that a remarkable building is so drastically altered, or that the result should be so illuminating.  Turrell’s<em> Aten Reign</em> is an important moment of reflection in the architectural life of the Guggenheim Museum.  It is open for a few more days only &#8211; don’t miss it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ]]></content> <link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/james-turrell-aten-reign-guggenheim/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=james-turrell-aten-reign-guggenheim#comments" thr:count="0"/> <link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/james-turrell-aten-reign-guggenheim/feed/atom/" thr:count="0"/> <thr:total>0</thr:total> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>admin</name> </author> <title type="html"><![CDATA[Studio Gang&#8217;s Diagonals Reshape Dorm Life]]></title> <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/studio-gang-uchicago-dormitory/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=studio-gang-uchicago-dormitory" /> <id>http://localhost/outoftheyards/?p=16</id> <updated>2013-11-08T06:35:36Z</updated> <published>2013-08-27T19:00:27Z</published> <category scheme="http://www.outoftheyards.com" term="Chicago architecture" /> <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chicago-based architecture firm Studio Gang last month unveiled renderings for its latest project, a new dormitory at the University of Chicago.  The design is smart and thoughtful, responsive to both the needs of the students who will live within and the local context of the University and Hyde Park neighborhood.

These residential houses are meant to be the focus of social and academic life for students living on campus.  Gang’s design translates this social organization into architectural form by imagining the core of each house as a literal three-story house.</p> <p dir="ltr">The three-story module derived from the suburban house becomes the social nucleus of each residential house in Gang’s design.  Each finished building &#8211; a complex of houses &#8211; results from a series of spatial operations on this nucleus.  First, dormitory rooms are added to both sides of this nucleus, extending the house into a long horizontal block through a process of accretion.  The buildings then rise up from the ground as an (almost) vertical stack of blocks.</p> <p dir="ltr">The distinction made between these blocks (and thus the houses they contain) using the stacking operation is important.  For students living in these dormitories, each house has a unique character formed by its residents and their shared experiences.  These differences between the houses are important because they provide students with a sense of belonging and group identity that is a main aim of the house system.  In Gang’s design, houses are stacked with a slight horizontal offset, rather than straight up.  This offset of each House from its neighbors above and below embodies the differences between Houses and their relationship to each other within the House system.</p> <p dir="ltr">Other contemporary architects such as Herzog &amp; de Meuron and SANAA have explored  the possibilities of irregularities in stacking floorplates in recent projects.  Gang’s design distinguishes itself from these projects by the disciplined logic of her application; where Herzog &amp; de Meuron and SANAA’s projects tend towards the arbitrary, Gang’s offset creates order.</p> <p dir="ltr">Horizontal and vertical elements play tag-team: here connecting, there dividing, always reinforcing the social organization of the house system.  Each house is primarily horizontal.  To balance this, Gang locates the vertical circulation for each house within a triple-height ‘house hub’ at the center of each house that becomes the dominant social space of the house.</p> <p dir="ltr">On the outside, the facades of the two buildings sited along University Avenue express elegantly the spatial organization within.  Dorm room windows are tall, the glazing reaching continuously up the height of each house.  Viewed together, the windows form a regular cartesian grid.  Tracing the edges of the masonry framing the windows exposes a field of diagonals stretching the full height of each building.  These diagonals proclaim the unity of the dorm as a whole.  It is perhaps here, on the facade, that Gang manages to best capture the complex part-to-whole relationships between student, House, and dormitory.</p> <p dir="ltr">While it is clear that Gang has attempted to organize the third and tallest building, situated along 55th Street, according to the same principles, compromises in the arrangement of the Houses leave the facade graceless and opaque.  Houses are staggered about a central vertical axis, rather than along a diagonal.  The resulting zig and zag pattern lacks the sense of resolution and integrity of the diagonal of the other two buildings.  More seriously, the heavy spandrels marking every floorplate &#8211; rather than every third &#8211; obscure the organization of the building into Houses.  The resulting facade is neither appealing nor descriptive.</p> <p dir="ltr">In plan, the void between the three buildings generates another powerful diagonal connecting the proposed plaza at 55th and University to the Smart Museum, one block over.  Gang has promoted this diagonal pathway as a connective thoroughfare uniting the new complex of buildings north of 56th Street to the older quads to the South.  Yet, upon reaching 56th Street, this vector runs straight into a four-story building &#8211; the Max Palevsky residence hall.  In order to continue to the main campus, pedestrians must retrace their steps East to find an aperture between Max Palevsky East and Central which serves as a back entrance to Bartlett quad.</p> <p dir="ltr">This zig-zag makes the diagonal a poor connection to the central campus.  Instead, the strength of this diagonal is its East-West link, uniting the new dormitory complex with the Smart Museum, the Court Theater, and, on the other side of 56th Street, Ratner Athletic Center.  Gang’s pathway will create an integrated quad which will serve as an anchor on the North end of campus.</p> <p dir="ltr">On the whole, Studio Gang’s designs are a sensitive response to the social organization of the dormitory system and to the location.  Architecture lovers should keep their fingers crossed that, as the building process enters its next phase, Studio Gang will stay true to the best parts of this design and continue to improve this project as a building which is elegant on the outside and thoughtful to those within.</p> ]]></content> <link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/studio-gang-uchicago-dormitory/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=studio-gang-uchicago-dormitory#comments" thr:count="0"/> <link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/studio-gang-uchicago-dormitory/feed/atom/" thr:count="0"/> <thr:total>0</thr:total> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>admin</name> </author> <title type="html"><![CDATA[Patient-Centered Design in the Foreground at Vinoly&#8217;s New Hospital]]></title> <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/rafael-vinoly-uchicago-hospital/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=rafael-vinoly-uchicago-hospital" /> <id>http://www.outoftheyards.com/?p=13</id> <updated>2013-08-30T18:21:42Z</updated> <published>2013-05-02T09:46:26Z</published> <category scheme="http://www.outoftheyards.com" term="Uncategorized" /> <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ego and expertise of the architect are both embodied in the University of Chicago Medical Center’s newest hospital, the Center for Care and Discovery, designed by Rafael Vinoly Architects.  The enormous hospital was Vinoly’s idea, successfully pitched eight years ago to the UCMC as the board began to plan the renewal of Mitchell Hospital.

but not diminished &#8211; by the demands of medical use.  At 1.2 million square feet, the new hospital is over a quarter the size of the Willis Tower.  It is ten stories tall, but because of large space between floors reserved for medical utilities and the two-story tall HVAC unit and helipad atop the building, it looks much taller.  More shoebox than obelisk, it fills two full city blocks and spans Maryland Avenue.  The form of the building is intended to reduce elevator trips, which are cumbersome for patients in wheelchairs and gurneys and waste time for doctors and nurses.  Compared with the courtyard design of the old Mitchell Hospital which the new Center is replacing, the large floor plates are meant to yield efficiencies of scale.</p> <p dir="ltr">Because of its scale, fitting the building into its context is a challenge.  Overlapping metal louvers banding the facade on the lower floors are designed to cast shadows that provide visual relief from the sheer vertical rise.  Likewise, bands of color &#8211; painted metal panels &#8211; and variations in the setbacks at different levels are designed to provide variety on the facade and reduce the mass of the building (Vinoly&#8217;s materials &#8211; sans brightly colored metal plates &#8211; recall his 2005 building for the Booth School of business anchoring the southwestern corner of the University of Chicago campus).  The result is a building that is enormous without being overbearing.  Remarkably, Vinoly has succeeded in integrating the building gracefully into the campus landscape.</p> <p dir="ltr">Functionally, Vinoly has divided the building along a vertical axis.  Joseph Cliggott, project manager at Rafael Vinoly Architects, says, “The exterior expression of the building conveys the 3 primary functions of the hospital:  the lower floors, where all the clinical procedures occur &#8211; the ‘Factory,’ as Rafael would describe it, the upper floors where inpatients recover from procedures &#8211; the ‘Home’ in Rafael&#8217;s words &#8211; and the Level 7 in between, or the ‘Garden’.”</p> <p dir="ltr">A hospital is demanding architecturally because of the intense physical and emotional demands of its users.  It is in the vast lobby on the seventh floor &#8211; the ‘Garden’ &#8211;  that Vinoly&#8217;s care for these emotional demands shows itself.</p> <p dir="ltr">Even in the middle of the day, the lobby is suffused in twilight.  The ceiling is veneered in lengths of dark cherry between which recessed lights sparkle at uneven intervals.  Like stars, the lights emphasize darkness, rather than illuminate space.  Far away, across the glossy white floor, floor-to-ceiling windows an uninterrupted view of the South Side.  Set above this bright strip of windows, capping it, the ceiling pushes down, compressing the space.  It is this overhanging presence which saves the Sky Lounge from being a cavern and reduces it to a more personal scale.</p> <p dir="ltr">This quiet twilight is a place where one can be publicly and unabashedly alone.  Leading by example, a player piano set off to the side plays old standards to itself.  In the middle of the room, in the heart of the twilight, one woman has folded herself onto a small couch and is sleeping uncomfortably.  Along the windows, where it&#8217;s brighter, more active patterns of use prevail: some people are working alone, while others talk quietly.  Vinoly has succeeded here in subtly using light, shadow, and color to divide the enormous room.</p> <p dir="ltr">At the Southwestern corner of the room is a small sign indicating &#8220;Chapel.&#8221;  The sign marks an alcove lined with curving walls of russet wood.  It&#8217;s a dead end at first sight.  The entrance, hidden in the wall, reveals itself only under careful investigation.  The door opens smoothly into an elliptical room, lit from above with clerestory windows.  All hard surfaces, it feels like being at the bottom of an empty seashell.  The space is sufficiently isolated to provide room for reflection, but too cold to give comfort.</p> <p dir="ltr">In the cafeteria, at the east end of the building, a different dynamic presides.  Like the Sky Lounge, the cafeteria is vast.  The ceiling and the floor are both white, accented by bright royal blue and orange.  Here, light is welcomed in, rather than held at arm&#8217;s length.  The wall on the north end of the cafeteria is faced in cherry; it marks the entrance to the massive boardroom, also paneled in cherry.  The wood veneer continues past the windows and wraps around the exterior facade, blurring the distinction between out and in.</p> <p dir="ltr">On the upper floors, patient rooms are placed around the perimeter of the building to take advantage of expansive views, shown by Roger S. Ulrich and other pioneers of evidence-based hospital design to improve patient recovery.  All patient rooms are single-occupancy for privacy and quiet, likewise shown to improve recovery and reduce time spent in the hospital.  These design decisions reflect a focus on patient experiences and outcomes that has been growing in American healthcare for the past twenty years.</p> <p dir="ltr">Like the Center for Care and Discovery, hospitals across the country have long been increasing the ratio of operating spaces to patient rooms and using architecture to reduce inpatient stays.  There are strong financial and medical reasons for doing so.  Especially in this hospital, financed by $500 million dollars of debt &#8211; presumably secured against future patient revenues &#8211; this focus on the patient is a wise decision.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Center for Care and Discovery will nestle comfortably and unremarkably into the skyline of the South Side; few will remember it as a distinctive piece of architecture.  But for many, it will be a place of healing and of comfort, and, if it accomplishes this, then it will be a job well done.</p> ]]></content> <link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/rafael-vinoly-uchicago-hospital/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=rafael-vinoly-uchicago-hospital#comments" thr:count="0"/> <link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/rafael-vinoly-uchicago-hospital/feed/atom/" thr:count="0"/> <thr:total>0</thr:total> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>admin</name> </author> <title type="html"><![CDATA[How can we build safe urban parks?]]></title> <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/chicago-parks-river-point-connors-studio-gang/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=chicago-parks-river-point-connors-studio-gang" /> <id>http://www.outoftheyards.com/?p=1</id> <updated>2013-09-03T21:43:20Z</updated> <published>2013-01-29T05:51:25Z</published> <category scheme="http://www.outoftheyards.com" term="Parks" /><category scheme="http://www.outoftheyards.com" term="Urban planning" /> <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The “Radiant City” is back.  Two high-profile buildings currently going up in Chicago draw on a park-centric model for development which has proven problematic in the past.

Abandoned by respectable people, they become the ideal setting for unobserved violent crimes.  We see this in New York City, where violent crime rates in City parks are currently leading the rest of the city and are increasing even as citywide crime rates have declined.  Thus do unsuccessful parks become cancers which destroy neighborhoods from within.  These are the stakes, and this is why it is important to be cautious and thoughtful as we install new parks in our cities.</p> <p>Yet green space continues to be a winning formula for developers and architects.  River Point, the 45-story downtown office building which broke ground on Tuesday, January 15, will be situated in a 1.5-acre park on the West bank of the Chicago River.  Plans for City Hyde Park, a mixed-use housing and retail development located at 51st and Lake Park Ave in Hyde Park, show a fully landscaped roof three stories above street level.</p> <p>The River Point park seems unlikely to succeed.   Located on the West side of the river, in an area currently dominated by parking lots and trainyards, it is a joint collaboration between the City and the developer meant to extend the Riverwalk.  Unfortunately, the park is isolated from its surroundings.  The park itself will sit on a platform above the train tracks, and plans show only three stairways up to the park.  In addition to naturally discouraging frequent, casual use of the park, the limitations on park access are dangerous, and, unless the park is well-patrolled, will make it an obvious target for criminals.</p> <p>The River West neighborhood is developing, and it is possible that over time, the park will become a central location.  Mayor Rahm Emanuel has proposed an ambitious project to redevelop the Riverwalk from Lake Michigan to the fork where the River Point tower sits.  This project, if and when it goes through, could make the River Point park more attractive and accessible from the Loop.  But at present, with its single-use tenant and discouragements to outside access, it seems likely that the park will stagnate.  It will become a place to hurry through at the beginning and end of the workday rather than a place to linger.  The developers and the city would have done better to integrate multiple uses into the development or to cut out the park altogether.</p> <p>The green space in the City Hyde Park project is different because it is intended for private, rather than public use.  It is relevant to us because it is partially funded with City money through a TIF (tax increment financing) division.  Designed by the much-admired Studio Gang, the building will serve a variety of uses, including retail at street level and apartments in the tower rising out of the green deck.  Yet the park space, which will contain the amenities for the apartment dwellers above, will be segregated from other users, and so will be denied both the dangers and the vitality of a social space that is a nexus for multiple uses.  Little harm will be done; the space will drag the neighborhood down no more than a seldom-used backyard.  But it will also contribute nothing spectacular.  As such, perhaps the city money diverted to the project would be better used to improve the district in other ways.</p> <p>One promising public-private partnership is falling into place now at <a href="http://blog.chicagoarchitecture.info/2011/08/06/public-park-privatized-in-chicagos-gold-coast/">Connors Park</a> in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago.  Connors Park, forgotten by the Chicago Park District, was littered and in disrepair, frequented by vagrants, according to Alderman Reilly, who initiated the partnership with Argo Tea.  Under the agreement, Argo Tea will be allowed  to construct a teahouse in the middle of the park and will, in turn, maintain and improve the park for the duration of its 15-year lease.</p> <p>A close look at the terms of the agreement reveals that the city has gotten an exceptionally good deal.  The green space of the park should be little altered, since Argo Tea is forbidden from expanding the amount of pavement (termed ‘hardscape) in the park.  In addition, the agreement stipulates that the tea shop must be as open as possible and its use, and the use of the park around it, must remain free.  In this case, since the failure of the park was due to its disrepair, the improvements and maintenance promised by Argo Tea will likely be enough to make the park comfortable and safe once again.  Yet we should expect more even than this.  Experiments like this in other cities, such as the food kiosks installed in Madison Square Park, Greeley Square, and Bryant Park in New York City, have been successful at drawing new visitors to enjoy and enliven the parks.  We should expect the Argo Tea in Connors Park to do the same.</p> <p>Parks should brighten and enliven their neighborhoods; they should be safe and friendly and inviting.  The “Radiant City” approach to urban planning and architecture encourages none of these.  Before we build more parks, we should look at our old ones, and ask: are they working?  Where parks are failing, we should ask why, and, where possible, implement agreements like the one at Connors Park.  Above all, we must think of parks always in the context of the overarching aim of urban planning: the creation of neighborhoods and cities which are safe, comfortable, and friendly.</p> ]]></content> <link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/chicago-parks-river-point-connors-studio-gang/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=chicago-parks-river-point-connors-studio-gang#comments" thr:count="0"/> <link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.outoftheyards.com/chicago-parks-river-point-connors-studio-gang/feed/atom/" thr:count="0"/> <thr:total>0</thr:total> </entry> </feed>
